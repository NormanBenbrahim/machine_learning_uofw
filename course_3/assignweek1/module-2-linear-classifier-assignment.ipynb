quality  I use cloth wipes for hands and faces and have been usingThirsties 6 Pack Fab Wipes Boyfor about 8 months now and need to replace them because they are starting to get rough and have had stink issues for a while that stripping no longer handles', 'it came early and was not disappointed i love planet wise bags and now my wipe holder it keps my osocozy wipes moist and does not leak highly recommend it', 'Very soft and comfortable and warmer than it looksfit the full size bed perfectlywould recommend to anyone looking for this type of quilt', 'This is a product well worth the purchase  I have not found anything else like this and it is a positive ingenious approach to losing the binky  What I love most about this product is how much ownership my daughter has in getting rid of the binky  She is so proud of herself and loves her little fairy  I love the artwork the chart in the back and the clever approach of this tool', 'All of my kids have cried nonstop when I tried to ween them off their pacifier until I found Thumbuddy To Loves Binky Fairy Puppet  It is an easy way to work with your kids to allow them to understand where their pacifier is going and help them part from itThis is a must buy book and a great gift for expecting parents  You will save them soo many headachesThanks for this book  You all rock', 'When the Binky Fairy came to our house we didnt have any special gift and book to help explain to her about how important it is to stop using a pacifier This book does a great job to help prepare your child for the loss of their favorite item The doll is adorable and we made lots of cute movies with the Binky Fairy telling our daughter about what happens when the Binky Fairy comes I would highly recommend this product for any parent trying to break the pacifier or thumb sucking habit', 'Lovely book its bound tightly so you may not be able to add alot of photoscards aside from the designated spaces in the book Shop around before you purchase as it is currently listed at Barnes  Noble for 2995', 'Perfect for new parents We were able to keep track of babys feeding sleep and diaper change schedule for the first two and a half months of her life Made life easier when the doctor would ask questions about habits because we had it all right there', 'A friend of mine pinned this product on Pinterest so I decided to give it a whirl It is fantastic If you are a new parent this will help you keep track of feedings diaper changes and the like', 'This has been an easy way for my nanny to record all the key events that happen with my baby when Im not at home  Would highly recommend it to someone who wants to stay informed of what your baby is up to while youre not homeThe only reason this isnt a 5 is because I think there could have been some more standarad preprinted optionsI plan on ordering another one when we run out of pages in this journal', 'I love this journal and our nanny uses it everyday to track on our daughters sleep eating and other activities The layout and design make it very easy to fill in quickly with a comments column to add in details ie we ask the nanny to specify what food she had for lunch amount of milk she took specifics of play timetummy time walk to park etc I love knowing the details of my babys day and I also use it to track weekly on overall schedule patterns and changes ie babys nap time has moved naturally as she gets olderMy only complaint is that there is no real space to communicate back to the nanny as I sometimes want to reply to the nannys comments andor leave her notes about the previous night ie Baby didnt sleep well or baby has rash etc or other instructions Please use sun screen on the baby  its hot out today that I often forget to tell her in the rush of the morning I just stick in postits now for my notes All in all I highly recommend this baby tracker', 'This book is perfect  Im a first time new mom and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings diaper changes sleep  Definitely would recommend this for new moms  Plus its small enough that I throw in the diaper back for doctor visits', 'I originally just gave the nanny a pad of paper to write down this information for my little one She would take him to the park and leave the pad behind  I was getting incompleteinaccurate information when she wohld get home at the end of the day and try to remember napsfeedingsdiaper changes I wanted something she could take with her and also a way to better control how she reported information This was the perfect solution Now Im getting all the information I wanted There is a very helpful example of how to fill it out It also has a pouch for additional documents and a section up front for emergency contact info Each page goes from 7  6 This works for me because the nanny starts at 7am and ends before 6pm I use an app on my phone for tracking when Im with the baby I transfer the info from this notebook to my phone My only complaint the space is pretty small  they provide useful shorthand but its a little difficult to fit some of the info in the space provided Also some of the other reviews complain about the 7  6 time format This isnt a real problem for me but I suppose if you wanted to track an entire day you would have to use two pages  not too big of a deal 7am  6pm is pretty much perfect for daycarenannycaregiver situation', 'I thought keeping a simple handwritten journal would be nice  But I havent used this thing at all and heres why1 When youre breastfeeding its often nice to have your phone close by so that you can keep yourself entertained  If you are able to grab both your phone and this notebook  and a pen  consistently  and at 3 in the morning  you are more skilled than me  I dont nurse in the same place every time2 Youre also often so sleep deprived that  at least for me  Id forget to look at what time we started on a side or what side we started on  Im not perfect with the app I have either but at least I just have to mindlessly hit a button3 I really like the app I have Baby Connect  It gives me better data  For example it can tell me how long on average feedings have been taking helpful as we start to think about sleep training  It can tell me that I nursed him 177 times last month granted that serves no useful purpose other than a feeling of perverse satisfaction', 'Space for monthly photos info and a lot of useful stickers come with it It is exactly what I wanted', 'I bought this calender for myself for my second son It is very colorful and has room on each page to write height weight and what baby likes to do There is also room on each page for a photo to be placed The calender date boxes have room for a sticker and some fine writing My only complaint is that it does not have as many stickers as I would like but I just put asterisks before whatever special event happened that day I bought one for a friend as she found it very useful as well', 'I love this little calender you can keep track of all of babys firsts I like the illustrations and the stickers too', 'This was the only calender I could find for the second year I did one for the first and wanted to continue cause there are so many things to note still after they turn 1 This one was better than the first year one I got him', 'I completed a calendar for my sons first year and really enjoyed tracking all of his milestones and special moments  so much so that I wanted to continue in the second year since hes still doing amazing and fun things every day  I really like the simple layout of the calendar and while it might not have all the questions and milestone stickers you want  at least its something to keep recording all those special moments', 'We wanted to get something to keep track of our childs milestones and this is a cute option There arent many other choices out there and this does exactly what we wanted', 'I had a hard time finding a second year calendar this is the only one I came across and it is great  Large enough to write in the squares and has a spot to put that months picture in as well as some memories The first two years they change so much I like to jot everything down so I can keep track of all the big milestonesand little ones  I find it is easier to do this on a calendar vs a baby book  This way you can fill out the baby book later and have a great reference to do so', 'I only purchased a secondyear calendar for my son because I had one for my daughter I was really disappointed with the lack of selection available for secondyear calendars in general so I just got this one because it was one of the only ones Its an okay calendar The finish on the pages is glossy which makes it hard to write on with certain pens The stickers arent very cute and the pages are pretty oldfashioned looking Hopefully they will come out with some other calendars for future purchasers', 'I LOVE this calendar for recording events of my sons second year of life  There are plenty of 1st year baby calendars out there and I loved reocording events of his first year and didnt want to just stop now that he is one  Natures lullabies second year calendar is perfect for continuing on with daily record keeping  The stickers are wonderful and helped me think of milestones to record that I might not have thought of on my own  I highly recommend this calendar  Plus its super cute and brat for either gender', 'Calendar is exactly as described but I find the look of it to be very cheap  There are lots of nice stickers to use  I was just disappointed it looks so cheap', 'Wife loves this calender Comes with a lot of stickers and options to mark the firsts Includes spaces for milestone photos as well Sticker borders for photos etc it is just a very easy to use scrap booking option Especially for new moms who dont have enough time to actually sit down and haul out a ton of scrapbook supplies', 'My daughter had her 1st baby over a year ago She did receive and fill up a First Year Calendar When her son was nearing his first birthday she was looking for a Second Year Calendar to record his milestones Thanks to Amazon I was able to get this for her and she LOVES it Tender sweet art work  helpful stickers  unique pages to fill A nice keepsake A wonderful gift for a oneyear old', 'Extremely useful As a new mom tired and inexpedient not remembering how long ago baby ate this definitely helped me through the first two months', 'My son loves peek a boo at this age of 9 months so I thought this book would be perfect This book doesnt engage him enough though it seems  He does however like the cover the most if I make pretend blowkisses and peekaboo gestures with the hands and show him He also likes when I fan the hair towards his faceMaybe when hes older he will flip the flaps but right now he just likes the mirror at the end and the front cover If I flip the book through he just takes the book and shakes it around', 'One of babys first and favorite books and it is washable I gave 1 less star than perfect because Id like to see some diversity in the people  not just your typical white family ', 'I like how the book has a hook to attach it to your stroller or car seat  it wont get lost  Great way to go over family members', 'Beautiful little book  A great little short story saying I Love YouKeeps the attention of the baby and then the baby can actually turn the pages and hold on to it when you are finished interacting with it', 'This book is so worth the money It says 9 months on the box but I cant wait for my baby to be born to try to use it before Its so cute and very interactive There are flaps to open on every page', 'we just got this book for our oneyearold and she loves it  Its so nice that she cant bite chunks out of it like she can a board book or rip it like a paper one  She can chew on it pull on it and carry it all over the house  She loves the little flaps that open and is learning simple words like daddy mommy puppy etc  We love it', 'The book is colorful and is perfect for 6months and older The only thing I didnt like was the strong smell of the dyes andor material I dunked the pages in detergent Then let the book dry overnight', 'The book is cute and we are huge fans of Lamaze products however this one leaves out some family members no little brother and can possibly cause hurt feelings That said our baby loves to play with the hands hair and flaps', 'What a great book for babies  Id been looking for books which couldnt be damaged by my 10month olds droolso cloth or plastic books were my options  This book adds another level to your usual cloth booka fun flap or moving part on every page  This interactive book is perfect for my baby', 'My son loved this book as an infant  It was perfect because he would chew on his board books and destroy them but this one we didnt have that issue  I love the Lamaze series they are a lot of fun not only for the child but for the parentI liked that this book was not only teaching my son about Peek a Boo but we used it to learn names for family members like grandparents sister cat dog etc  And of course with it being a lift the

tricky to open but of course that was the idea Recommended to keep your socks 34friended up34', 'As another reviewer noted these are great for matching socks before washing  Now once the socks come out of the washer I hang them to dry with the pins still on  The socks stay on the line to dry without clothespins they just hang with one sock on each side of the line  After they are dried I just open the pin and leave it by the hamper on a shelf  As I put dirty socks into the hamper I grab a pin and use it  Has saved a lot of time and I dont have the problem of lost socks or mismatched socks

hard to work it through a thicker fabric  Would not recommend', 'I really thought I was getting a dozen pinsturns out I should have counted the pins in the pictureas there are only 10 I am sadand I
